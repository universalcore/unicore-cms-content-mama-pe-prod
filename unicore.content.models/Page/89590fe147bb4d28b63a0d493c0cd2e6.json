You may notice stretch marks appearing as your belly grows, or the colour of your skin may change on some parts of your body.\r\n\r\nYour skin may get more sensitive. This is partly because of higher hormone levels. But your skin also becomes more stretched and delicate. It is a good idea to wear loose, comfortable clothing to help with this.\r\n\r\nIf you wash regularly and keep your skin clean during pregnancy, it will help. Use soap and clean, safe water. Make sure that you rinse all the soap off your skin. Any soap left behind could cause itching and soreness. Now is a good time to use oils and creams to keep your body soft and smooth.\r\n\r\nYou may see a dark line appear on your belly. It can be as wide as your thumb, and sometimes crosses your belly button. It shows up where your stomach muscles stretch to give your baby more room. The line fades a few weeks after you have given birth.\r\n\r\nYou may see darker or lighter patches on your forehead, cheeks and neck. This is caused by your body making a hormone to protect your skin against sunlight. Being out in the sun will make the patches darker, making them show more. To protect your skin, cover your head and body when you go out. The patches fade about 3 months after your baby\u2019s birth.\r\n\r\n",
