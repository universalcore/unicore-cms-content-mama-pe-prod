The surest sign is a missed period, but you may find it hard to remember the date of your last period.\r\n\r\nDo you have any of these signs of pregnancy?\r\n\r\n - \tYour breasts look and feel different \r\n\r\n - \tYou notice some spots of blood in your underwear \r\n\r\n - \tYou feel nauseous\r\n\r\n - \tYou need to pass water more than usual \r\n\r\n - \tYou miss a period\r\n\r\nIf you think you are pregnant, it is best if you see a midwife. The earlier you find out, the sooner you can start planning for your new baby. A midwife will also be able to give you advice and help while you are pregnant.\r\n\r\nThe midwife will weigh you, check your blood pressure and test your water. \r\n\r\nWorried about seeing a midwife? Ask a friend to go with you.\r\n\r\n",
