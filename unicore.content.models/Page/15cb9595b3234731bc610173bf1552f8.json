Fruits like oranges, bananas, apples, mangoes, papayas and peaches are good. Get lots of them. Try to have 1 extra handful of food with every meal. Do not go without food for too long. Carry some food with you if you have to go somewhere.\r\n\r\n2.\t**Get check-ups** while you are pregnant. Try to have 6 prenatal control visits to your health centre. Get your blood and urine (water) tests and blood pressure checks done regularly. These tests help to find problems early. Then you can get treatment and keep yourself and your baby safe. \r\n\r\n3.\t**Get tested for HIV-AIDS if you are worried.** If you are HIV+, there are medicines to help keep you well and prevent your baby from being born HIV+. If you find out you are not HIV+, you can make sure you stay that way.\r\n\r\n4.\t**Take your pregnancy tablets.** These tablets help your baby grow well. Ask your health worker if you can get them free from the midwife. \r\n\r\n5.\t**Keep clean.** Wash your hands with soap before cooking and eating and after using the toilet. \r\n\r\n",
