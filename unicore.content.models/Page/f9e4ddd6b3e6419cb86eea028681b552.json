You need extra care in early labour to prevent the HIV-AIDS virus being passed to your baby. \r\n\r\nWhen your baby is here, it is important that you both take your ARVs. \r\n\r\nYour baby needs a daily dose of ARV syrup for 4 to 6 weeks after the birth, to protect him from HIV-AIDS. Your baby will need a blood test at the clinic at around 6 weeks to check if the HIV-AIDS virus has passed to him.\r\n\r\nMake sure you touch your baby with clean hands. Cover all cuts and wounds with a bandage until they heal. \r\n\r\nHIV-AIDS is a long-term illness. With the right medicines, you can manage and control it. \r\n\r\n",
