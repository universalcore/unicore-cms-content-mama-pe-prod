If you eat foods from these 4 main food groups you will get the minerals you need.\r\n\r\n - \tFruit and vegetables. Eating lots of different coloured fruit and vegetables will give you lots of goodness.\r\n\r\n - \tStarchy, filling foods, such as rice and potatoes. Base your meals around starchy foods. This will give you plenty of energy.\r\n\r\n - \tProtein-rich foods, such as eggs, fish, poultry and meat. These foods are also good sources of iron. They will help you to stay strong.\r\n\r\n - \tCalcium-rich foods such as cow\u2019s milk. \r\n\r\nBy eating a range of these foods you will be able to stay fit and strong, as well as grow a healthy baby.\r\n\r\n",
